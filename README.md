This repository was created thinking about the releasing of the SteamDeck. As a user of Linux, I know how hard could be to someone to enjoy all features of the OS without knowing how to use the terminal. Going further, the LOptionsDeck can store commands for Steam, games and Linux itself.

# Main goals

* Making a easy program to copy the commands to clipboard.
* Work on every operation system (I know the initial idea is to run only in Linux).

# Important

* If the command needs administrator privileges, the user needs to have  a explicit disclaimer letting him/her know that this command can damage his/her system. (Also if it's only a update system command)
